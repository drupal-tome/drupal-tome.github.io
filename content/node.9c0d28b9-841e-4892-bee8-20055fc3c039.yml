      <p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>&nbsp;is a static site hosting company that has a powerful free offering. If you're looking to host a commercial Tome site this is a great option.</p>

      <h2>Deploying the Tome template</h2>

      <p>Netlify supports template projects, which are the fastest way to get started on their platform. To use the Tome template&nbsp; that comes with the <a href="https://github.com/drupal-tome/bookish">Bookish </a>profile (good for blogs), click the button below:</p>

      <p><a class="button" href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/drupal-tome/netlify-template"><img alt="" data-entity-type="" data-entity-uuid="" src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" title="Deploy to Netlify" /> </a></p>

      <p>You'll be prompted to login or create an account, then a Tome site will be automatically provisioned for you.</p>

      <h2>Configuring netlify.toml</h2>

      <p>If you're connecting to Netlify manually and not using the template, you should understand how to configure Netlify to properly build Tome. Netlify supports a root-level configuration file, "netlify.toml", which contains environmental variables and commands used to build your static site.</p>

      <p>The currently recommended netlify.toml configuration is:</p>

      <pre>
      <code class="language-bash">[build]
      command = "composer install &amp;&amp; ./vendor/bin/drush tome:install -y &amp;&amp; ./vendor/bin/drush tome:static -l $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL"
      publish = "html"

      [build.environment]
      PHP_VERSION = "7.2"
      </code></pre>

      <p>If you copy + paste this to netlify.toml in the root of your Tome project, you should be set to deploy to Netlify.</p>

      <p>There isn't a lot of secret sauce in this file, but it's worth noting that "$DEPLOY_PRIME_URL" is used to dynamically determine the base path of Drupal based on where the build will be deployed. Netlify supports multiple domains per branch, so you don't want to hard-code a URL.</p>
