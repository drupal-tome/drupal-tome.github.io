            "value": "<p>While anyone can download and install Tome on a new or existing Drupal site, it works best when used with specific Drupal configurations. This guide will take you from creating a new site to making your first commit.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before continuing, it\u2019s expected that your local machine has:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>PHP 7 or greater installed.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>SQLite&nbsp;3.26+&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Composer installed globally.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<p>A global Drush installation is not required to use Tome, but is easier to use than typing \u201c.\/vendor\/bin\/drush\u201d every time you want to run a command. This guide will assume that the \u201cdrush\u201d command is available.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To start, create a new instance of the starter project by running:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-bash\">composer create-project drupal-tome\/tome-project my_site --stability dev --no-interaction --no-install\r\ncd my_site\r\ncomposer install\r\ngit init\r\ngit add .\r\ngit commit -m 'Initial commit of starter codebase.'<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The starter kit only comes with Drupal core, so you\u2019ll probably need to install contributed themes and modules as well. Eventually the starter kit will come with a Tome-specific distribution, which will be the recommended way to make simple sites. Since Tome is still in development, things are bare-bones for now.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Optional:<\/strong><em>&nbsp;<\/em>This is a good time to install a contributed install profile, for example <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/drupal-tome\/bookish\">Bookish<\/a>&nbsp;which is specially crafted for Tome blogs. You can see a demo of Bookish at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/bookish-drupal.netlify.app\">https:\/\/bookish-drupal.netlify.app<\/a>&nbsp;to see if it's something you'd like to use. To install Bookish, run \"composer require drupal-tome\/bookish\".<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next you\u2019ll need to initialize your site by choosing an install profile. Run:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-bash\">drush tome:init<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don't want to use Bookish, I would recommend&nbsp;using the \"Standard\" profile when prompted, since it comes with a default theme and content types. If you installed Standard, you will probably want to uninstall the modules that don't make sense for a static site. To do this, run:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-bash\">drush pmu search history contact -y<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\r\n<p>If you run \u201cgit status\u201d at this point, you should see that the \u201cconfig\u201d folder is full of exported configuration. You\u2019ll want to commit those changes now so you have a base to work off of in your history. Run:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-bash\">git add .\r\ngit commit -am 'Installed the Standard profile.'<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Next you\u2019ll need to start up a local webserver. In a new tab, run:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-bash\">cd [path to your my_site codebase]\r\ndrush runserver 127.0.0.1:8888<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Then switch back to your original tab, and run \"drush uli -l 127.0.0.1:8888\"<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A browser window should pop up and log you in as admin.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now you\u2019re ready to start using Drupal to build you site. Let\u2019s start by adding a new article. Expand \u201cShortcuts\u201d in the admin toolbar, click \u201cAdd content\u201d, then \u201cArticle\u201d. Fill out the fields to your liking, and make sure to upload an image.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once your article has been created, go back to your command line window and run \u201cgit status\u201d. You should see that&nbsp;two new files exist in the \u201ccontent\u201d directory, one for the article node you made, and one for the file you uploaded. There should also be a copy of your uploaded file in the \u201cfiles\u201d directory. Feel free to commit these files now if you\u2019d like.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tome is always watching your site for changes, and automatically syncs modified config, content, and files as needed. Running \u201cdrush tome:export\u201d, which exports everything currently on your site, should be pretty rare after your initial install.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019re going to test that your site can be fully rebuilt from scratch, to ensure that everything is working properly. Run:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-bash\">drush tome:install<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\r\n<p>If you visit your site again, you should see that your article and image as they originally appeared.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though your site doesn't have much going on yet, let\u2019s test the static site generation as well. Whenever you\u2019re ready to generate static HTML for your site, run:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-bash\">drush tome:static<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\r\n<p>This should put a copy of your site in the \u201chtml\u201d directory, which you can then upload to a host of your choosing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Optional<i>:<\/i><\/strong>&nbsp;If you're using Bookish, you'll need to index your search results before running \"drush tome:static\". For more information, visit \/admin\/help\/topic\/bookish_help.tome on your local site to view the related Bookish Help Topic.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>That's it for now. You're free to start making your Tome site. Make sure to check out the other documentation, and keep in mind that the project is still in development. Thanks!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n",
